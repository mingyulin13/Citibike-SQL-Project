## Citibike-SQL-Project

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to practice SQL and Tableau skills I have learned over the course of my study. I created some key questions that served as the framework of this project. Each question required querying the database, exporting the result set, and creating the corresponding visualization in Tableau.

### Background:
Citibike is a bike sharing service in NYC. The service began operating in 2013 with 17,000 bikes and served in more than 1,000 stations. The bike sharing service was acquired by the company Lyft in 2018. It remains one of the popular transportation methods in NYC.

### Key Questions:
- Who use citibike more each year, men or women?
- What user type uses citibike the most overall? 
- What is the average trip duration per month? 
- What are some of the most used bikes? 
- What are some of the most popular routes? 
- What are the top 10 start stations and top 10 end stations? 

### Toolkit:
SQL (Big Query) for data analysis
Tableau for data visualization
Word for reporting

Dataset:
new_york_citibike dataset from BigQuery public data
